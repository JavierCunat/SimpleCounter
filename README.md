# SimpleCounter AND102 Lab I

## Overview
In this lab, you will build a simple counter app, similar to popular idle tap mobile games.
Idle tap games track the number of times a user has tapped on the screen, and allow users to accumulate points that can be exchanged for upgrades.

### Required Features
- [x] A simple version of the app with core features implemented will just track the number of times a user has tapped on a button
- [x] A more advanced version of the app with stretch features implemented will more closely mimic a true idle tap game, where users can see customizations and purchase upgrades.
